	We are technological prodogies, here to inovate and make the world a better place. I, Jonathan Kim, see myself as a Korean Elon Musk, except people like me, and I'm smarter and better looking than him. Like yesterday, I saw a homeless man on the street, and gave him a strawberry. Also, I'm better than Josh. He's bad at code. </p>
